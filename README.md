# **Note Taker**

## Project Description
Note Taker is a web application that allows users to create and delete notes that are stored on a server. Note Taker accomplishes this by having an interactive user interface to create the notes, which when saved are then stored on a JSON file via a back end node script. Creating new notes appends them to the JSON file, and deleting notes deletes them from the JSON file.
